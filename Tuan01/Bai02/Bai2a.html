        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong>
            was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics,
           <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
           and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
           prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and 
           papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.Euler's work on mathematical analysis,<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook
           in the field for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
           <cite>Lettres &agrave une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, giving a clear non-technical
           outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>
        <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. 
            Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced 
            in Eu best know for research into mathematical analysis Euler's formula.</p>
        <p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var> <sup>(<var>ix</var>)</sup>
        <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
                    and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
                    the equation
        <p><var>e</var><sup>(&pi; <var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0
        <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
                    a single beautiful and elegant statement.
        <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
                a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
                of mathematics.</p></p>
